### Hi there, I'm Bauke ğŸ‘‹

I'm a deep learning practitionerğŸ§ /data scientistğŸ“ˆ. I have a background in computer science and data science, and thus both are very prevelant in my work. I have created some bots, some deep learning implementations and some libraries related to synthetic data. 


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on setting up a personal website and synthetic data using GANs.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full Stack (Deep/machine) Learning 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about PyTorch and SOTA NLP or Computer Vision models! ğŸ”¥ğŸ”¥
- ğŸ˜Š My favorite machine learning sources are [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co), [Sotabench](https://sotabench.com) and [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com)
